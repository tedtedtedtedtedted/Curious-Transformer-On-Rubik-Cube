## Name
- Curious Transformer.
     - Curious: Curiousity-driven learning.
     - Transformer: Attention mechanism.
     
## Core Idea:
- Transformer $\in$ Reinforcement Learning $\rightarrow$ Decision Transformer.
- Decision Transformer (offline) + Curiousity-driven Learning $\rightarrow$ Curious Transformer (online).
- No expert data.
- No problem-specific, hard-coded algorithm.
- No overkill with models like GPT-3.
- [ ] Apply Curious Transformer to solve $3 \times 3$ Rubik's cube.
- [ ] Generalize to $d \times d$ Rubik's cube.
- [ ] Generalize to any reinforcement learning tasks.


## First time setup
1. In the directory with the file setup.py, run the command:
```Shell
pip install -e .
```
or equivalent for your package manager (or `python3 -m pip install -e .` if it doesn't work).

2. Run rubiks.py to check if everything works.

3. Import Cube from rubiks to start building intelligent agents :)
