- Name: Curious Transformer.
     - Curious: Curiousity-driven learning.
     - Transformer: Attention mechanism.
     
- Core:
     - Decision transformer uses offline RL, but we combine curiousity-driven learning so that it becomes online.

First time setup:
1) In the directory with the file setup.py, run the command:
```Shell
pip install -e .
```
or equivalent for your package manager (or `python3 -m pip install -e .` if it doesn't work).
2) Run rubiks.py to check if everything works.
3) Import Cube from rubiks to start building intelligent agents :)
