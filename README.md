- Theme: Invariance learning.

- Goal: No rush into finding an algorithm, but to explore ways of learning & discovering invariance by messing around.

- Philosophy: Inspired by music for example, jazz is joyful because it encapsulates some invariance, even if it is invariance of certain dissonance; Inspired by problem solving, always play around to seek properties/invariance to solve a problem. Maybe the reason human or mammles play is to discover invariance. Maybe that's why Shaul likes to play with fidget spinner (because spinning is a invariance).

- Starter:
	1. Set up with OpenAI 
	2. Given small tasks		
		1. Greedy
		2. Composite
		3. Random/genetic
		4. RL
	3. Explore new invariance itself and evaluate discovered invariance by some metric:
		- Resembleness/closedness
		- Symmetry
			- [ ] Stage 1: Human defined
			- [ ] Stage 2: Machine invented symmetry
	4. ~Dynamic programming (store these trick)
	5. Global strategy planner
		- [ ] Stage 1: Human instructed
		- [ ] Stage 2: Machine planner
